Basic Concepts
--------------

KonFoo is based on declaring a byte stream mapper through classes.

KonFoo base on two abstract classes the `Container` class and the
`Field` class. A container holds a container and/or field classes.

A field holds the value of byte area which the field represent.

The mixin `Pointer` class has both features of the two base
classes and has an interface to a data provider.
